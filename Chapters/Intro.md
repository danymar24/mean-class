# Introduction

## Pre requisites
To start developing our project we need to set up some things:

* Node.js
* Angularcli
* Mongodb

During the chapters of this course we will be covering the installation of these requisites and we will create a TODO application with the MEAN stack.

## Node.js
To start developing our application we need to install Node.js, we will be using NVM for windows (If you are using a different OS like linux or Mac OS you can use [this link](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) to make the installation easier.

Download the installation file and install: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.5/nvm-setup.zip

Once installed open the command prompt as administrator and use ```nvm install 6.10.2```.

# Angular Cli
Once we have Node.js we have to install Angular cli globally, in command prompt we can use ```npm install -g @angular/cli```.

# MongoDB
We have to install MongoDB community server, to do that we have to go the official site and intstall it: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community

TIP: You can add mongodb to the PATH to make the run easier.

Once you have the requisites we can start developing our TODO app, continue to the Chapter 1 to continue.
